Open source music bot. Current code is not tested and may have little mistakes that I'd rather not have.

You can clone this rep if you want, because let's be honest I am not a good programmer and this is basically the same as the examples in [here](https://github.com/Solaris9/erela.js/tree/b13718a881d2774acfa9979669df979fe884728f/examples)

# I want to use this! What do I need? (said no one)

- Lavalink's latest build
- your own config.json file with the token, prefix and node options.
- obviously a [bot application](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

Worth to mention that if you get weird errors from Lavalink you may need to update it from the [CI server](https://ci.fredboat.com/project.html?projectId=Lavalink)
